### Minor Project

 Tittle : Implementation of Semaphores for solve the problem of Critical Section (os based project)

 intro : In this project i had a team of three members including me .firstly study the basic concepts related to this project then implement 3 basic pyhton programmes in first for semaphores, second for critical section and third for solving the critical section problem using semaphores.

### Major Project....

Tittle : Blockchain Powered E-Commerece Web Page

Intro : in this project i had two members including me . In this project Blockchain Technology is used . Ethereum is used for database and HTML , CSS is used for web page desiging in frontend .In Ethereum Solidity and smart contracts are used .smart contracts are basically a program for solidity to run the Ethereum for database.

### 4 week Training 
What I had learn during 4 week training

#### History Of Blockchain

- The blockchain technology was described in 1991 by the research scientist Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. 
- In 2004, computer scientist and cryptographic activist Hal Finney introduced a system called Reusable Proof Of Work(RPoW) as a prototype for digital cash.
- Further, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualized the theory of distributed blockchains.

#### Blockchain

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

#### Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is defined as a form of digital tokens or “coins” that exist on a distributed and decentralized ledger called a blockchain.

- Types of cryptocurrency
  - Ethereum (ETH)
  - Bitcoin 
  - Litecoin (LTC)
  - Cardano (ADA)
  - Polkadot (DOT)
  - Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
  - Stellar (XLM)
  - Dogecoin (DOGE)
  - Binance Coin (BNB)

#### Proof of Work 

This is basically an Algorithm Which is used to confirm the transaction and create a new block to the blockchain.

#### Ethereum

Ethereum is second most popular cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin.to use Ethereum firstly we need to learn about Smart Contracts And Solidity.

##### Smart contracts 

Smart Contracts are basically a programme stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.

#### Solidity
-	Solidity is known as a contract-based, high-level programming language
- This platform has a similar syntax to the scripting language of JavaScript
- This platform also supports inheritance in object-oriented programming, inheritance enables new objects to take on the properties of existing objects.

#### DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION
